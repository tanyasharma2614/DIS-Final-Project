Load Balancing Algorithms

Our goal is to assess and evaluate various load balancing techniques in a simulated network environment.  Typically, Load Balancing is accomplished through conventional techniques such as round-robin, random, and weighted round-robin. However, in this particular project, we aim to introduce a novel approach by utilizing heaps to achieve Load Balancing in a Network. 

To achieve this, we have coded to simulate a network from scratch, implemented 8 different types of Load balancing strategies, and measured their performance based on relevant performance metrics.
